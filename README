Reshd
=====

Description
-----------

Reshd stands for remote Erlang shell daemon. It offers a telnet port
into an Erlang shell in the Erlang node.

Example session.
----------------

First we need to start the reshd in the erlang node:

   109> reshd:start(40044).
   {ok,40044}

Then we can connect to this node:

    unixprompt% telnet localhost 40044
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    Eshell V5.0.1
    1> io:format("Hello world!~n").
    Hello world!
    ok
    2> exit().
    ** Terminating shell **
    Connection closed by foreign host.
    unixprompt%

There is also an Emacs package, resh, which provides means for
connecting to the Erlang from within Emacs. Type as follows:

    Connecting:
    Type M-x resh RET to connect to the erlang node. 

    Compilation buffer:
    Type C-c s in the resh-buffer to set the current buffer as the
    current inferior erlang compilation buffer. Now, when you type
    C-c C-k, the compilation command will go directly into that erlang
    node.

Caveats

* There is no tab completion and parentesis blinking like in the
  ordinary Erlang shell. However, if you use resh from within Emacs,
  to connect to the Erlang node, all your line editing wishes will
  be fullfilled. 
* There is no authorization procedure, and the connection is not
  encrypted. 
* There are no privileges. Any function in any module is callable for
  anyone.
